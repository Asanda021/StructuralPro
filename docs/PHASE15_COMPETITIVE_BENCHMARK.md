# StructuralPro — Phase 15 Competitive Benchmark Baseline

## Purpose

Phase 15 freezes the competitive baseline for StructuralPro before capability-parity implementation begins. It compares the product surface against representative Iranian quantity/estimating workflows and current foreign takeoff/estimating products.

This document is a scope baseline, not a claim that every capability is already implemented.

## Status vocabulary
- implemented — executable StructuralPro capability is already present and tested.
- contract — a stable interface/adapter exists, but an external runtime, converter, dataset, or client is still required.
- roadmap — capability is assigned to a later mandatory roadmap phase.
- benchmark-only — competitor capability is useful as a comparison point but is not independently required unless covered by the mapped phase.

No capability is left unclassified.

## Competitor capability anchors

### PlanSwift

Current PlanSwift documentation exposes digital takeoff for area, length, count, slope and volume; symbol counting; cutouts; multi-scale plans; plan overlay/comparison; annotations; assemblies; custom formulas/templates; material and labor libraries; Excel integration; and configurable reports. Its current Takeoff BOOST suite adds AI-assisted Auto Takeoff, Auto Count, Auto Scale and Auto Bookmark.

### Bluebeam Revu

Bluebeam documentation covers PDF takeoff measurements such as length, area, volume, perimeter and count, with custom columns and Excel Quantity Link workflows.

### Autodesk Takeoff / BIM benchmark

Autodesk Takeoff remains a benchmark target for integrated 2D/3D/BIM takeoff and model-aware quantity workflows. This is represented by the BIM and drawing-intelligence rows above rather than by treating a viewer alone as sufficient.

### Iranian benchmark

Iranian professional workflows are represented by the mandatory P16/P17 scope: فهرست‌بها، ریزمتره، خلاصه متره، BOQ، ضرایب، آنالیز بها، صورت‌وضعیت، تجمعی، کسورات و گزارش‌های مالی/فنی. The baseline intentionally treats these as first-class product requirements, not optional localization.

## Baseline decision

Phase 15 is complete when:
1. every benchmark capability has a unique ID;
2. every capability is classified;
3. every required capability is mapped to a mandatory implementation phase;
4. no benchmark row is orphaned;
5. later phases cannot silently omit a capability from this matrix.

Any new capability discovered after this freeze is treated as a user-requested future feature/version, unless it is required to satisfy an already-listed row or a Phase 33 final re-benchmark gate.

## Relationship to implementation

The repository's existing BENCHMARK_COVERAGE.md remains the implementation-coverage rule: a named capability is not considered implemented merely because a registry entry exists; executable handlers or tested adapters are required.

Phase 15 therefore freezes what must be covered. Phases 16–35 implement, validate and release that scope.
